## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ice-reporter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure the application for your location (see Configuration section below)

4. Run the development server:

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Configuration

The application is designed to be location-agnostic and can be easily configured for any city or region. Edit the `APP_CONFIG` object in `pages/index.tsx`:

```typescript
const APP_CONFIG = {
  title: "ICE Reporter", // Your app title
  description: "Report and track ICE activity in your community", // App description
  defaultCenter: [41.8236, -71.4222] as [number, number], // [latitude, longitude] for your location
  defaultZoom: 13, // Initial zoom level (1-18)
  showCountyBoundary: false, // Set to true to show county/region boundaries
  countyBoundary: null // Add GeoJSON data for boundaries if needed
};
```

### Example Configurations

**For Los Angeles, CA:**
```typescript
const APP_CONFIG = {
  title: "ICE Reporter - Los Angeles",
  description: "Report and track ICE activity in Los Angeles County",
  defaultCenter: [34.0522, -118.2437],
  defaultZoom: 10,
  showCountyBoundary: true,
  countyBoundary: losAngelesCountyGeoJSON // Add your GeoJSON data
};
```

**For New York City:**
```typescript
const APP_CONFIG = {
  title: "ICE Reporter - NYC",
  description: "Report and track ICE activity in New York City",
  defaultCenter: [40.7128, -74.0060],
  defaultZoom: 11,
  showCountyBoundary: false,
  countyBoundary: null
};
```

## Usage

### Viewing ICE Activity

2. The map shows your configured location with red markers indicating reported activity
3. Click on any marker to view detailed information including:
   - Description of the activity
   - Location details
   - Timestamp of the report
   - Associated images or videos

### Reporting ICE Activity
1. Navigate to the "Report Activity" tab
2. Fill out the form with the following information:
   - **Description**: Detailed description of what you observed

   - **Image URL** (optional): Paste a direct link to an image (e.g., from Imgur)
   - **Video URL** (optional): Paste a YouTube video link
3. Click "Submit Report" to add the sighting to the map

### Location Services

## Data Structure

Each ICE activity report contains:
```typescript
interface Sighting {
  id: number;                    // Unique identifier
  description: string;           // Description of the activity
  location: string;              // Human-readable location
  coordinates: [number, number]; // GPS coordinates [lat, lng]
  timestamp: string;             // ISO timestamp
  imageUrl: string | null;       // Optional image URL
  videoUrl: string | null;       // Optional YouTube video URL
}
```

## Important Notes

### Community Guidelines
- **Accuracy**: Please provide accurate and truthful information
- **Verification**: All reports are community-sourced and should be verified independently
- **Privacy**: Be mindful of privacy concerns when reporting activity
- **Safety**: Do not put yourself in danger to gather information

### Technical Limitations
- **Client-side Storage**: Reports are stored in browser memory and will be lost on page refresh
- **No Backend**: This is a frontend-only template; production use would require a backend database
- **Geolocation**: Requires user permission and HTTPS in production
- **Image/Video Hosting**: Users must host media on external services (Imgur, YouTube, etc.)

## Customization Options

### Adding County Boundaries
To add county or regional boundaries:

1. Obtain GeoJSON data for your region
2. Set `showCountyBoundary: true` in APP_CONFIG
3. Add your GeoJSON data to the `countyBoundary` property

### Customizing Map Style
The map uses OpenStreetMap tiles by default. You can customize the map style by modifying the tile layer URL in `MapComponent.tsx`.

### Adding Custom Features
The modular design makes it easy to add:
- Custom marker icons
- Different map layers
- Additional form fields
- Filtering and search functionality

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Database storage for persistent reports
- **User Authentication**: User accounts and report management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter reports by date, location, or type
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
- **API Integration**: Integration with external mapping and geocoding services
- **Moderation System**: Report verification and moderation tools
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for different communities

## Contributing

This is a template application designed to be easily adapted for different communities. For production use, consider:
- Adding a backend API for data persistence
- Implementing user authentication and authorization
- Adding data validation and moderation features
- Integrating with external services for geocoding and media hosting

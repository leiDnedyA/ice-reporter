### Community Guidelines
- **Accuracy**: Please provide accurate and truthful information
- **Verification**: All reports are community-sourced and should be verified independently
- **Privacy**: Be mindful of privacy concerns when reporting activity
- **Safety**: Do not put yourself in danger to gather information

### Technical Limitations

- **No Backend**: This is a frontend-only template; production use would require a backend database
- **Geolocation**: Requires user permission and HTTPS in production
- **Image/Video Hosting**: Users must host media on external services (Imgur, YouTube, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Database storage for persistent reports
- **User Authentication**: User accounts and report management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter reports by date, location, or type
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
- **API Integration**: Integration with external mapping and geocoding services
